    <description>MockJockey is a framework written in and for Csharp assemblies with the purpose of allowing engineers to unit test their code in a precise, concise, and quick manner. Using mock objects in unit tests, allows your unit tests to be focused by side-stepping any irrelevancies of the test. Commonly thought as a necessity for doing test driven development, a mock framework will give your tests exactly what they need to be--small and fast! And that's what MockJockey provides us.</description>
